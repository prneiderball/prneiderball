🌟 **Welcome to my GitHub!**  
I'm a full stack Javascript Dev with a passion for building things that actually work not just in theory, but in real-world environments.

Currently focused on full-stack development, I'm also exploring legacy technologies like COBOL and JCL to deepen my understanding of the foundational systems that continue to power much of today’s infrastructure.

I’m enrolled in the TripleTen Software Engineering Program and actively supplementing my education with independent study in:

Computer science fundamentals

Data structures and algorithms

Scalable, real-world software design patterns

I’m here to learn, build, and contribute...whether it’s through clean code, thoughtful collaboration, or just figuring out how to make things better, one commit at a time.
